# HackNights

Join us at the next HackNight, always on the third Thursday of every month!

An evening of socializing and dinner among HackerSchool members, open to the public, where activities and projects that have been developed are discussed, as well as future plans. After dinner, there is usually time for the creation of short-term themed projects.
