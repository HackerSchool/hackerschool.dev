# 🎉 Workshop Template

Welcome to your workshop page template! This document serves as a structured guide for creating engaging workshop pages in Markdown format.

## 📋 How to Create a Workshop Page

Follow these simple steps to create your own workshop page:

1. **Copy** this template into a new file, naming it `workshop-name.md`.
2. **Modify** the header with the relevant information for your workshop.
3. **Write** your content using Markdown syntax.

It's that easy!

## 🖼️ Adding Images

To include images in your workshop page, simply use standard Markdown syntax, like this:

![Workshop Image](image1.jpg)

Make sure the image is in the `workshop-template/` directory.

## 📹 Embedding YouTube Videos

To embed a YouTube video in your workshop page, you can use the following HTML syntax:

{{< youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc >}}

This will display the video directly on your page, allowing attendees to watch without leaving your content.

## 💻 Adding Code Snippets

You can add code snippets within triple backticks, like so:

```python
# This is some Python code
def doing_your_mom(me, your_mom):
    if me in your_mom:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

```bash
# This is some Bash code
sudo pacman -Syu python
python doing_your_mom.py

# Here's a really long command to see how it wraps:
echo "This is a very long command that will help demonstrate the text wrapping feature in Markdown, ensuring that everything looks neat and tidy."
```

Inline code can also be included using backticks, like this: `some code here`. Cool, right?

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that you have the template set up, get creative! Customize it with your unique content, and let your workshop shine. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out!
